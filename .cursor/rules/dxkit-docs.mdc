# dxkit-docs

All new features, modules, and significant changes must be accompanied by clear documentation. Use the following structure for docs:
- `VISION.md` or `ABOUT.md`: High-level context, purpose, and results.
- `PRINCIPLES.md` or `PHILOSOPHY.md`: Project philosophy, key principles, and adoption/community vision.
- `ROADMAP.md`: Refactor plans, modularization, and future work.
Documentation should be concise, use markdown, and be placed in the `docs/` folder.
