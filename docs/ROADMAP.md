# Project Ideation & Refactor Plan â€“ @dxkit

## Overview

This document captures the ideation, vision, and concrete refactor plan for
transforming the @dxkit dev tools into a dynamic, modular, and configurable
library ready for JSR publishing and real-world use.

---

## Project Goals

- Modularize for maintainability and tree-shaking
- Provide a clear, extensible public API
- Empower developers with robust, easy-to-use tools
- Ensure readiness for open-source adoption and JSR publishing

---

## Proposed Modular Structure

```
dev-tools/
  mod.ts                # Main entry point (public API)
  config.ts             # Configuration management
  logger.ts             # Logging utilities
  system.ts             # System info, memory, env validation
  health.ts             # Health check logic
  performance.ts        # Performance measurement utilities
  utils.ts              # Generic helpers (formatBytes, sleep, etc.)
  types.ts              # Shared types/interfaces
  README.md             # Usage, API docs, config instructions
  test/                 # Unit and integration tests
```

## Key Refactor Steps

1. **Split code into modules** as above
2. **Centralize and validate config** (env, file, code)
3. **Modular, extensible logger** (levels, sinks, formatters)
4. **System info, health, and performance modules**
5. **Utility functions** in their own file
6. **All types/interfaces** in `types.ts`
7. **Public API** via `mod.ts`
8. **Unit and integration tests**
9. **JSDoc and README**
10. **Ready for JSR publish**

---

## Configuration System

- Support env, programmatic, and file-based config
- Use schema validation (e.g., valibot, zod)
- Allow extensibility for custom fields

---

## Logging Module

- Multiple log levels
- Custom formatters (plain, JSON, etc.)
- Pluggable log sinks (console, file, remote)
- Contextual logging (request ID, etc.)
- Dynamic log level changes

---

## System & Health Modules

- System info, memory usage, env validation
- Health check logic, extensible with custom checks
- Aggregate health results, simple API

---

## Performance Module

- Performance measurement and benchmarking
- Support sync and async functions
- Optional hooks for custom metrics

---

## Utility Functions

- formatBytes, formatDuration, generateId, sleep, etc.
- Export only those needed by consumers

---

## Types & Interfaces

- Centralize all shared types/interfaces in `types.ts`
- Export all public types for consumers

---

## API Design

- Re-export main features in `mod.ts`
- Allow singleton and instance-based usage
- Well-typed and documented public APIs

---

## Testing & Documentation

- Add unit and integration tests for all modules
- Use Deno's built-in test runner
- Add JSDoc comments and a comprehensive README

---

## JSR Publishing Readiness

- Ensure `mod.ts` is the entry point
- Add versioning and changelog
- Run `deno check`, `deno lint`, and all tests
- No Node.js-specific APIs

---

## Advanced Features (Optional)

- Plugin system for custom loggers, health checks, metrics
- CLI for health checks, config dump, etc.
- HTTP endpoint for health/metrics (web dashboard)

## Summary Table

| Area        | Current State | Recommendation                         |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Config      | Env + update  | Add file, schema, extensibility        |
| Logging     | Console       | Add sinks, formatters, context         |
| Health      | Static        | Allow custom checks, extensibility     |
| System Info | Basic         | Add more info, extensibility           |
| Performance | Basic         | Add benchmarks, profiling              |
| API         | Singleton     | Allow multiple instances, tree-shaking |
| Types       | Good          | Fix linter errors, strict types        |
| Docs        | Minimal       | Add JSDoc, README, usage examples      |
| Tests       | Unknown       | Add unit/integration tests             |
| Publish     | Not ready     | Modularize, doc, test, version         |
