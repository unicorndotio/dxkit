## üì¶ Packages

This monorepo is managed as a
[Deno Workspace](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/projects/workspaces) and
contains the following packages:

| Package         | Description                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `@dxkit/core`   | Core package re-exporting all modules              |
| `@dxkit/config` | Configuration management                           |
| `@dxkit/log`    | Logging utilities                                  |
| `@dxkit/denv`   | Environment validation                             |
| `@dxkit/sys`    | System and memory information                      |
| `@dxkit/perf`   | Performance measurement utilities                  |

| `@dxkit/cli`    | (Planned) Command-line interface                   |

## üöÄ Getting Started

Since `@dxkit` is a workspace, you can directly import modules from other local
packages in the workspace.

For example, you could create a `main.ts` in the root and use the logger:

```typescript
import { Config, Logger } from "./packages/core/mod.ts";

const config = new Config();
const logger = new Logger(config.get());

logger.info("Hello from @dxkit!");
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

This project uses Deno for task management.

- **Check types**:
  ```sh
  deno task check
  ```

- **Lint files**:
  ```sh
  deno task lint
  ```

- **Run tests**:
  ```sh
  deno test
  ```
